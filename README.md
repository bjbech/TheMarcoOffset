# The Marco Offset

This is the repository for the website [TheMarcoOffset](https://themarcooffset.com), a calculator to figure out your Marco Offset amount.

## What is The Marco Offset?

The Marco Offset is a way to calculate your minimum donation to Relay for the St. Jude fundraiser based on a method devised by [Marco Arment](marco.org) on the [Accidental Tech Podcast](atp.fm). 

To calculate:
1. Subtract the base model price of an iPhone or iPhone Pro from your total purchase price.
2. The difference is your minimum donation.

### Include in your total purchase price:
- Phone upgrades (storage, size, etc.)
- Accessories
- AppleCare (monthly cost multiplied by 12)
- Taxes
- Shipping costs

## Enhancements to Add

- **Multi-country support**: Expand the functionality to support different currencies. Thinking best to probably add Canada, GBR, and the Euro. [Github Issue](https://github.com/bjbech/TheMarcoOffset/issues/4)
- **Additional Apple products**: Support for calculating donations based on the purchase of other Apple products such as Apple Watch, AirPods, etc.
- **Product selection checkboxes**: Replace the current dropdown of iPhone models with checkboxes for multiple product types (e.g., iPhone, Watch, AirPods) to allow users to select multiple products.
